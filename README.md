## Hi, I’m Fiorella 👋  
**Junior Data Scientist | Python · Statistics · EDA**

I’m a **Junior Data Scientist** with hands-on training in data analysis, statistics, and exploratory data analysis, working on end-to-end projects using **Python (pandas, NumPy)** and real-world datasets. I enjoy structuring messy data, identifying patterns, and turning analysis into clear, actionable insights.

My background is **non-traditional and international**, which has shaped how I work: I possess strong analytical thinking, am highly adaptable, pay close attention to detail, and have the ability to work **autonomously in remote, multicultural environments**. I learn best by solving real problems and iterating through data-driven workflows.

When I’m not diving deeper into Data Science, you’ll probably find me **marathon-reading romance or fantasy books**, **teaching English**, or **spending time outdoors**. Those spaces keep me curious, focused, and grounded.
